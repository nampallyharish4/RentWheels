## Algorithms Used

### Booking Algorithm

```pseudocode
function checkAvailability(vehicleId, startDate, endDate):
    bookings = getExistingBookings(vehicleId)
    for booking in bookings:
        if (startDate <= booking.endDate && endDate >= booking.startDate):
            return false
    return true
```

### Price Calculation

```pseudocode
function calculatePrice(vehicleType, duration, extras):
    basePrice = getBasePrice(vehicleType)
    durationPrice = basePrice * duration
    extrasPrice = calculateExtras(extras)
    return durationPrice + extrasPrice + calculateTax()
```

### Vehicle Matching

```pseudocode
function matchVehicle(requirements):
    availableVehicles = getAvailableVehicles()
    return availableVehicles
        .filter(v => meetsRequirements(v, requirements))
        .sort(v => calculateMatchScore(v, requirements))
```
